- what we will see:
1.user inputs the name, age
2.add the amount to the wallte
3.get the card and will be asked to play hidden or shown
4.asked to input the bet amount
5.one by one bet amount will be increased
6.if player want to quit it will write end to end the game and the win amount will be given accordingly


-winning conditions:
 - any three number is the most valuable according to the card value
  - if both has 3 same number card then the value will be checked
 - then it comes the pure sequence which has same suit
  - if both has sequence then value of the sequence will be checked
 - then it comes the same suits
  - again biggest value card player will win
 - then raw sequence which has different suit
  - if both has sequence then value of the sequence will be checked
 - two same number
  - if both has two same number then value of that same number will be checked
   - even the same number is also same then the third card's value will be chacked and bigger value card holder will win
 - two same suits
  -first the value of the card will be chacked
   -if the suit is same then value of the suit card will be chacked
 - then at last biggest value card is winner

- game flow:
 - asked for name then vlidating name
 - asked for age then valdating age
 - asking to add amount in the wallte
 - player cards has be divided do you want to see it (y/n)?
 - showing the playercards
 - are you ready to bet(y/n)?
 - enter the bet amount
 - showing the result of the computer
 - asking to play the next move(y/n)?
 - enter the bet amount

-concepts can be used here:
 -recursion
 -forEach
 -callback function
 -higher order function
 -to optimize the code i can use the concept of modules also which will be easy to manage the whole game 

-implimentation of the game flow:
 - player validation will be done seperately
 - bet amount validation will be done seperately

-progress:


-computerAutomation function:
 -on the next move this function will call
 -the calculation of the bet function will be called
 -


-bet calculation logic
 -comp will not have access to the player cards.
 -it will have the access of the player bet.
 -it will evaluate the cases like which case is apply to the cards
 -then the range of the bet amount will be calculated, it will be random between the interval based ont the cases.

 //later things which can be done
 -making more random by using more random conditions like comp will randomly increase the bet by large amount and sometimes increase by the small amount
